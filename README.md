The VB libraries on this repository are very useful for numerical computing, mathematical modeling and customized financial algorithm development. All the functions were designed to make computations on arrays (i.e., vectors or matrices) simply and quickly. Most of them could be easily change to C++ for efficiency. I also shared comprehensive and robust optimization routines that enable calibration of financial models in Excel; and provided extensive web data processing examples for wrapping and visualizing financial data in seconds.
